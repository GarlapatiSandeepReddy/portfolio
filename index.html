                    <h3>Coding</h3>
                    <p>I took interest in coding in my sophomore year in my undergrad. I feel computer science is a 
                        reflection of our everyday world.

                    <h3>Playing Guitar</h3>
                    <p>When I visited my brother's place in my high school, I started playing random vidoes on youtube,
                        and I came across movie "Surya s/o Krishnan" a Tamil movie. This movie inspired me to start playing
                        guitar. I bought my first guitar when I am a junior in my undergrad. I am currently an intermediate level
                        player.

                    <h3>Making delicious food.</h3>
                    <p>I am a big foodie since my childhood. I always enjoy eating delicious food and sometimes, it's like
                        a stress buster to me. After moving to United States for my masters, I started cooking and took a liking
                        towards it.
